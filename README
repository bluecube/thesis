This is my master's thesis, titled Exploiting GPS in Monte Carlo Localization, finished and submitted :-)

Abstract: This work presents two approaches for integrating data from a low cost GPS receiver
in a Monte Carlo localization algorithm.
Firstly, an easily applicable method based on data in the standard NMEA protocol is shown.
Secondly, an original algorithm utilizing lower level pseudorange measurements accessed in
binary receiver-specific format is presented.
In addition, a set of tools for analysis of GPS measurement errors on receivers
with SiRF III chipset was implemented.

There are some some experiments with GPS in the /impl/ directory.
