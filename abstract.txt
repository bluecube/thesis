The goal of this work will be to use GPS as a correction input to the
Monte Carlo localization and 

The simple use of GPS for localization uses the position estimations provided by
the GPS receiver in a WGS84 format. However, this estimation has problems with
hard to use error estimations, low output frequency and mostly undocumented
filtering of the values.

The approach taken in this work will use pseudorange measurements to modify
sample probabilities in the Monte Carlo localization. When combined with
odometry and eventually other sensors this method could improve the precision
of the GPS fix, when compared to using only precomputed WGS84 coordinates.

There are several consumer grade receivers that allow access to raw pseudorange
data, this work will be using mainly the SIRFstarIII chip.
