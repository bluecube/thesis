====== Notes ======

The Sirf III provides raw pseudoranges and has excellent tracking,
but it is missing carrier phase information. It may be useful for
static positions in poor conditions where other receivers are unable
to track at all

Carrier phase is used to smooth pseudorange measurements in SIRF message 28.
This means that for any other receiver this will have to be handled differently (at least the errors will have to be measured again).

===== Measurement domain integration vs position domain integration: =====
-> Undersanding gps 9.3.3.1
I'm concentrating on measurement domain integration, but should say something about position domain too. And measure performance.


===== Things to try: =====
Use something better than just linear extrapolation when calculating the SV position at given time. We know that it's going at almost circular path. This could bring the errors to less than [[~20cm/sec]]

Use precise ephemeris

Elevation angle cutoff (10deg ?)
