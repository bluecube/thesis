====== 04-MCL-correction ======
Created Wednesday 28 March 2012

Next experiment is basically a rewrite of the measurement code of number 03, 

I need to monitor each individual satellite for signal quality.
- use differences in pseudorange -- if the value is jumping too wildly then drop the whole satellite
- Thread reading from the GPS keeps data current, callback when new data is ready
  - Every SV? After the whole window is received? Sirf window is followed by sv state messages. How big error comes from using the older sv state?
      => An experiment .... old_sv_state.py => about 20cm. And that's a lot.

There needs to be a gps thread running that gives out the messages when they are ready.
It should probably keep recently measured data, run some filtering on it and only report new _valid_ data.
The idea with having the gps thread inside the correction class probably won't work.
At least for `errors2.py` I will need to use it without the correction class.
