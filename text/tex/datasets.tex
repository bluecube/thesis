Three sets of measured GPS data were recorded for this work.
All of them were recorded using a portable USB/serial receiver with SiRF 3 chip
in the SiRF binary protocol.

\begin{itemize}

\item
First dataset contains approximately one month of recorded SiRF data.
During this period the receiver was stationary inside a room and had good signal 
reception. 
It was used for modelling of the GPS measurements errors in \autoref{chap:gps_and_mcl}.

The dataset contains \num{2363458} measurement cycles and
\num{22726200} pseudorange measurements.

\item
The second dataset is considerably shorter, consisting of two recordings made during
the Robotour competition \cite{robotour} on a Roboauto Karlík \cite{karlik} robot\todo{Better citations?}.
These data were used as an input for Monte Carlo Localization for performance comparison in \autoref{chap:performance}.

In total the dataset contains \num{1531} GPS measurement cycles with
\num{16261} pseudorange measurements, accompanied by sensor recordings from Karlík.

\item
The last dataset is for debugging purposes only and contains approximately
30 minutes recorded with stationary receiver with very bad signal quality.

\end{itemize}

\autoref{fig:hdop_hist} contains histograms showing the distribution of HDOP values in the datasets.
%Missing from the plots are outliers with HDOP more than 10.
