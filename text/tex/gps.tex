\chapter{GPS}
\label{chap:gps}

This chapter contains a overview of Global Positioning System and
its basic operation.
Next it describes methods of obtaining receiver position and velocity,
error sources of GPS measurements and methods of dealing with these errors.
Lastly it discusses properties of consumer grade GPS receivers.

Global Positioning System is a global navigation satellite system (GNSS)
developed and operated by U.S. military.
GPS provides three dimensional position and velocity measurements as well as
precise time source for every place on earth with direct satellite visibility.

GPS consists of a constellation of at least 24 satellites (space vehicles, SVs),
control segment and end-user receivers.

\begin{itemize}
\item The satellites are orbiting approximately \SI{20200}{km} above earth surface.
\item 6 nearly circular orbits
\item Ongoing modernization

\item Control segment consists of a network of ground facilities and is responsible for
monitoring the satellite constellation and send commands and data to the satellites,

\item There are several GPS signals with different properties
and more will become available with modernized satellites,
however all these signals can be divided to encrypted military signals 
(Precise Positioning Service) and unencrypted
civilian signals (Standard Positioning Service).

The unencrypted signals are available worldwide without any limitations,
however they are also susceptible to spoofing attacks, however complicated these are
\cite{tippenhauer11}.

\end{itemize}

%\section{History}
%Prior to development of GPS, a satellite navigation system called Transit was operational
%since 1964.
%Transit measured 2D positions of stationary or slow moving receivers based on
%Doppler shifts of the satellite signal \cite{transit-www}.


\section{Operation Principles}

\subsection{Time of Arrival measurements}

GPS calculates position by measuring the time it takes for a signal
emitted from a known position to reach reach the receiver.

Each GPS satellite transmits a pseudo random sequence (PRN signal),
containing timing information.
The receiver is able to replicate and match this sequence and therefore
is able to determine the transmission time of the signal.

If the position of satellites is known and all clock in the system are
synchronized, the position of the receiver
can be calculated as an intersection of at least three spheres centered around the satellites
and with radius corresponding to signal time of flight.

In reality, receiver clock offset needs to be calculated
during localization witch adds a new dimension to position determination.

\subsection{Time and GPS}

One of the functions of GPS system is a dissemination of precise time.
%This is necessary to calculate position

There are three basic time frames appearing in the GPS system.

\subsubsection{GPS System Time}

GPS System Time is a paper time scale based on atomic clock standards in GPS
satellites and on the ground.
This time standard is not directly available neither in SVs or in user receivers.

GPS system time is related to UTC.
It is a continuous time scale, not adjusted for leap seconds
and it is required to be within \SI{1}{\micro\second} from UTC modulo \SI{1}{\second}.

\subsubsection{SV Time}
SV Time is a value that satellites transmit in their ranging signals,
obtained from the satellite's atomic clock.
Although the atomic clock standards are highly stable, the offset between SV
Time and GPS System Time may reach up to \SI{1}{\milli\second} (equivalent to
\SI{300}{\kilo\meter}).
Corrections for this offset are periodically calculated by the control segment
and uploaded to the satellites for broadcast (and therefore known to the
receiver).

\subsubsection{Receiver Time}
Receiver Time is a time that is kept by the GPS receiver clock.

Receivers are usually equipped only with simple crystal oscillators
and aren't capable of keeping precise time.
This is solved by adding the clock offset as a fourth dimension of the receiver position.
Having clock offset as a part of the navigation solution makes it easy to calculate
precise time after a fix is obtained by adding the offset to the receiver clock.

\subsection{Reference Frames}

\subsubsection{ECEF}
Earth-centered Earth-fixed is a Cartesian reference frame widely used in the GPS system.
As the name suggests, origin of ECEF is in the Earth's center of mass, the \(XY\) plane coincident
with equatorial plane, \(X\) axis in the direction of
\ang{0} longitude, \(Y\) axis in direction of \ang{0} East and \(Z\) axis going
the direction of geographical North pole.
%Figure \ref{fig:ecef} illustrates 

\begin{figure}[h]

	\input{img/ecef.pdf_tex}
	\caption{Diagram of ECEF reference frame.}
\end{figure}

Results of ephemeris calculations are in ECEF coordinates
(see section \ref{sec:gps-ephemeris}) and receiver positions are calculated
in ECEF as well.
All later GPS calculations in this work will be in ECEF reference frame.

\subsubsection{WGS84}
World Geodetic System 1984, defined in \cite{nima04}
serves as Earth model for GPS.
Exact values of the model have been updated several times in the past,
but these changes have been too small to be problematic for most practical
applications.

The WGS84 reference ellipsoid is used to convert between ECEF coordinates and
Latitude/Longitude geodetic coordinates.
Procedure for this conversion can be found in \cite{nima04}.
Height measured from the ellipsoid can be obtained during the conversion,
however historically heights should be measured from sea level.
Sea level roughly corresponds to geoid -- a surface with constant gravity
potential -- also defined in WGS84.

%with semi major axis \(a = \SI{6378137.0}{\meter}\)
%and inverse flattening \(\frac{1}{f} = \frac{a}{a - b} = 298.257223563\).


\subsection{Ephemeris}
\label{sec:gps-ephemeris}

Ephemeris in the context of GPS means data describing satellite positions
at given time.

GPS satellites transmit messages containing ephemeris together with the ranging data.
These messages describe the satellite orbit using a set of Keplerian orbital parameters.

\marginpar{Keplerian parameters? They are unimportant for the thesis, and it takes three
pages to define them properly ... think of something better to write}

\subsubsection{Precise Ephemeris}
Precise ephemeris are satellite ephemeris data calculated by ground stations
and distributed separately from the GPS broadcast.

Source of precise ephemeris is is \cite{orbit-data}
These datasets mainly contains post-processed past data, but predictions for
next several hours are also available.
While the quality of these predictions is lower than of the off-line data,
they are still several times more precise than the broadcast ephemerides
(\(5 cm\) RMS versus \(100 cm\) RMS, according to \cite{orbit-data, macdonald01}).

Precise ephemeris files contain satellite positions in ECEF
coordinates and clock offsets in 15 minutes intervals and must be interpolated
before using them for navigation \cite{schenewerk03}.

\section{Kalman Filters}
Kalman filters are often used in the GPS receivers to merge past
data with incoming measurements or to combine the GPS position and velocity
estimation with another source of measurements, for example acceleration data.

For more detailed description of how Kalman filters operate see section
