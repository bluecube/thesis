I would like to thank to the supervisor of this thesis,
RNDr. David Obdržálek, Ph.D. for his guidance and advice on this thesis.

I would also like to thank to my family and friends for patience (mostly) and
support during the long time it took to finish this work and to all the people
around me who didn't run off screaming every time I started babbling about pseudoranges.

The team of Roboauto Karlík let me record real life data from their robot at the
Robotour competition and Tomáš Ondráček helped me with parsing of Karlík's log files.
Thank You.

I would like to thank my mom and Marika for language
corrections during the last few days before submission date.
It is because of them that sentences in this thesis mostly have beginning,
middle and end.

And finally thanks to my lazy self, for not backing out this time.
