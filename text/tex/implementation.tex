\chapter{Implementation}
\label{chap:implementation}

A proof of concept implementation of both approaches from \cref{chap:gps-and-mcl}
was created with this work.
The following chapter describes this implementation, its design and
specifics of the GPS receiver used.
Detailed usage information for the tools described in this chapter are located in
\cref{chap:usage}.

Python programming language was chosen for the implementation,
because of the speed of development and large number of available libraries.
As mentioned above, it is intended only as a proof of
concept and for further experimenting; a \enquote{real world} implementation
would probably be written in C or C++, for increased performance and better portability
to embedded systems, using libraries like GPSTk \cite{tolman04} for the low level GPS access.

\section{Design}
\begin{itemize}
\item Record / replay
\end{itemize}

\section{What's specific to SiRF}
\label{sec:impl-sirf}
\begin{itemize}
\item All measurements normalized to common time
\item Relativistic errors are already taken care of \todo{Really?}
\item SV positions given in ECEF, instead of orbit parameters
\item Carrier phases are not reported, but are used to smooth pseudorange measurements
    This sucks.
\item \ldots
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Communication With SiRF Chip}
\begin{itemize}
\item Detection / switching: SiRF binary <-> NMEA
\item Parsing and building SiRF messages
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Clock Jumps in SiRF Output}
SiRF III chipset appears to internally modify its clock when the clock offset
becomes too large.
This causes problems when processing the raw data, because reported clock values
can't be relied on being monotonic.
Example of this is shown in \cref{fig:impl-clock-jumps}.

To work around this problem, we measure difference between average measurement
errors and when it becomes very large (larger than \SI{1e6}{\meter} proves as an
appropriate value) we mark this measurement as a skip and estimate the skip
length to match the difference between previous pair of average errors.

\subsection{Mapping Coordinate Frames}
\label{sec:impl-coordinates}


\section{Measurement Domain Error Model}

In contrast to the previous approach, the whole localization process is kept in
the ECEF coordinate frame, because GPS of the amount of GPS data being processed.
