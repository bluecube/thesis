\chapter{tl;dr}
This chapter provides an overview of the thesis in a form as condensed as possible.
Intended for anyone who knows both GPS and MCL and dislikes reading long texts.

\begin{itemize}
\item
Using low level GPS data as a sequence of correction inputs to Monte Carlo Localization.

\item
Communication with GPS receiver
\begin{itemize}
    \item Standard NMEA protocol doesn't contain enough detail for advanced usage.
    \item SiRF 3 chips with binary SiRF protocol is implemented, but the
    approach should be adaptable to other receivers without major modifications
    \item \Cref{sec:impl-sirf}
\end{itemize}

\item
NMEA data as MCL input
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simpler, less CPU intensive, drops some information when the results are
    wrapped in lat / lon / hdop for WGS84
    \item Working in 2D, no need to modify MCL samples
    \item
        Fitting curve to measured data:
        \begin{equation*}
            \mathrm{DRMS}(\HDOP) = \sqrt{(\num{4.941}\HDOP)^2 + \num{3.568}^2}
        \end{equation*}
    \item \Cref{fig:wgs84-hdop-error}, \cref{sec:wgs84-hdop-error}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
