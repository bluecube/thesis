\chapter{tl;dr}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Using low level GPS data as a sequence of correction inputs to Monte Carlo Localization.

\item
Communication with GPS receiver
\begin{itemize}
    \item Only SiRF 3 chips with binary SiRF protocol is supported, but the
    approach should be adaptable to other receivers without major modifications
    \item \autoref{sec:impl-sirf}
\end{itemize}

\item
NMEA data as MCL input
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simpler, less CPU intensive, drops some information when the results are
    wrapped in lat / lon / hdop for WGS84.
    \item
        Fitting curve to measured data:
        \begin{equation*}
            \mathrm{DRMS}(\HDOP) = \sqrt{(\num{4.941}\HDOP)^2 + \num{3.568}^2}
        \end{equation*}
    \item \autoref{fig:wgs84_hdop_error}, \autoref{sec:wgs84_hdop_error}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\todo{Write this once there are results.}
