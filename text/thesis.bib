The formulation represents the user's position as the intersection of two planes and a hyperbola branch of revolution. The formulation is three-dimensional and includes almost all degenerate and special case geometries. It provides geometric insight into the characteristics of the solutions and resolves existence and uniqueness questions regarding solution of the pseudo-range equations}},
